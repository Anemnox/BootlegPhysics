      <h1>Simple Physics</h1>
      <p>
        A naive implementation of 3D physics that I created in 2020 to learn the
        basics of constraining collisions of 3D objects. This is a brute force
        implementation of collisions that uses point-to-plane intersection to
        decide the constraints of movement. In addition, there is a naive
        approach to creating reactionary forces at the contact point of the
        object. Though, I would not say that it is remotely accurate to how
        objects experience forces.
      </p>

        I leave this up as a funny project from when I was still playing around
        with creating physics engines and as a visual demonstration of what
        could be created coming from a non-formal background of developing
        engines (I'm not sure if there is a formal background for this though).
        There are many improvements I would make to the system if I were to
        create this again such as broad-phase collision checking with spatial
        hashing and even narrow-phase collision checks for complex objects using
        spatial hashing. I would also properly implement a momentum conservation
        function that will properly resolve the momentum of objects during
        collisions.

        For now, Here is a project that lets you spawn items inside a cubical
        room. Click on a button and click inside the box to spawn an object
        inside. You may also click on items in the box to apply a random upwards
        force on them. There are many bugs (such as tunneling and improper
        normal forces) but I hope you have fun using up your computer's CPU on
        this.
